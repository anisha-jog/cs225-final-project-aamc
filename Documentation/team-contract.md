# Team Contract
 
## Communication
Team Meetings<br>
Our team will not have weekly meetings, but will maintain consistent communication via a Discord group. Team members will organize meetings if necessary and these will most likely be over Zoom. Each member commits to responding to the Discord at least once per week. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with at34. The note-taker is responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry at least 24 hours before it is due, which is then approved by the team during those 24 hours.<br>
Assistance Each team member can be contacted through email, Discord, or text. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours and Discord messages within 24 hours.<br>
Respect The note-taker for the week will serve as the ‘project lead’ for the week. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has spoken about their goals, opinions about design decisions or anything else related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.<br>
 
## Collaboration
Work Distribution<br>
Each week, the deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. If no one volunteers, a member will be randomly assigned to work on the task if they have not chosen a deliverable to work on or if they have a lighter workload for the week. If this leads to an unbalanced workload, adjustments will be made on a case by case basis.<br>
Depending on teammates’ workload for other classes and their availability, excluding emergencies, extra work may be allocated to those with more free time. If anyone is particularly interested or experienced in a specific portion of the project, they are allowed control over its development.<br>

## Time Commitment
To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than 2 and no more than 5 hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. If a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation, further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members.<br> 

## Conflict Resolution
If there are disagreements, team members are expected to act in a rational and respectable way. If a team member has not completed their task, other team members will remind them/see what they are doing. In case a team member is consistently unresponsive, the other team members will remind them of their expectation and time commitment and may decide to contact course staff. The issue where a member is habitually late may not be a regular occurrence, but if it is, a similar process will be followed: gentle reminder followed by a serious reminder. If unresponsiveness continues indefinitely, course staff may be notified.<br>
