Overall, we accomplished our goals.

# Our deliverables

- Our makefiles runs as expected
- We properly read in our Google web graph and built a graph based on it
- We have thoroughly tested our graph and algorithms for bugs and memory leaks

# Algorithms & Traversals

- Our BFS traversal appopriately handles, and even continues to work in a disconnected graph
- Our PageRank algorithm is implemented ...

We have decomposed our project into a Graph class, and an algos namespace, where our static functions algorithm functions are located.
Wherever possible, we have observed good programming habits; this may be through git, documentation, etc.
